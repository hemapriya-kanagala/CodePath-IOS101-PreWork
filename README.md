## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### Favorite Apps & Features:
#### (a) Spotify:
Spotify is one of my favorite apps for music. I love how it recommends new songs based on what I listen to, and the playlists are very well curated. Another feature I find helpful is the offline download option, so I can listen to music anytime without needing the internet.
#### (b) WhatsApp
 WhatsApp is simple but very powerful when it comes to communication. I appreciate how fast and reliable the messaging is, and I like that I can change the background color of each chat to personalize it. Deleting or archiving old messages is also a nice feature that helps me stay organized.
#### (c) Notion
 Notion is a flexible app that I use for writing, planning, and tracking tasks. I like how I can organize everything in one place and customize pages the way I want. It’s great for personal use, projects, or even team collaboration.

### App Idea:
So this is the idea I have, an AI bot that helps people understand cybersecurity in really simple, everyday language. I’m thinking of building it using the Gemini API. The bot would answer questions like what phishing is, how to stay safe online, or how to create strong passwords, without using technical jargon. It would also support translations into different languages, so more people can access and learn from it easily. The whole goal is to make cybersecurity feel less intimidating and more like having a helpful, friendly guide you can talk to anytime.

## Notes

This was my first time using Xcode, so it took some time to figure things out. I ran into a few errors along the way, but I was able to solve them with the help of Stack Overflow. Overall, I think this is going to be a great learning experience for me.
